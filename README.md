This is my successor project to
[Sonne8](https://github.com/michaelmangelsdorf/Sonne8), a cpu/micro-controller built with
74HC series logic chips, some CMOS memory and passive-components only.

I've built a little working computer with it as a proof-of-concept. The new project over here
will help me explore a modified version of the CPU a little more and write software for it,
before developing more hardware.

The schematics have been stripped of everything I thought wasn't essential, so it's a bit
easier to read. In order words, although it's possible to load the schematics file into KiCad,
its intended use is only for reference.
